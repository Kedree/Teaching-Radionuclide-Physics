# Teaching-Radionuclide-Physics
This repository contains the original works I created to teach radionuclide physics to my RT4220 students at Wayne State University, in preparation for their careers and board exams. The important files here are the results and lectures:

A very kind thank you letter I received: RT4220 F2025 Parting Gift Thank You Letter Testimonial.pdf
Their grades throughout the course: F2025 Anonymized Grades.csv
The lectures and their audio versions: Lecture Recording Links.txt and /Lecture PDFs
